/-! Question:
7. Let the partially ordered set $X$ satisfy the d.c.c. You have just devised a proof that if a certain property of elements of $X$ is true for every $y<x$ in $X$, then it is true for $x$ (where $x \in X$ is arbitrary). Can you conclude that your property is true for all $x \in X$ ?

/-! Informal proof:
First, we can show that the set X is well-founded because X satisfies d.c.c.  
Then, it's easy to use the well-foundedness of X to inductively prove the result.
